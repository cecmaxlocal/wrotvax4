**Understanding the Goal**

I'm focusing on the user's request for a `servers.yacc` file. Recognizing "yacc" points me towards parsing and a tool like YACC. My initial step involves dissecting the user's need, specifically breaking down how a YACC parser would be used for server configurations. I'm moving toward visualizing the required grammar and the structure of the parsing rules.


**Designing the Grammar**

Now, I'm digging into the design of the actual configuration language. I want to build a simple structure for server definitions, including aspects like server name, port number, perhaps a description, and, yes, the cost, to address the dollar sign question. I'm visualizing the grammar rules – how these components will be structured within the Yacc file – and how I can represent the server configuration and related monetary values with this design.


**Expanding Server Properties**

I'm now enriching the configuration language. Besides the core server details, I'm integrating 'tags,' which will be represented as a list. I'm also carefully considering how to handle costs, specifically the "$120.50 / month" format, which presents a parsing challenge and will influence the structure of my lexer and parser. The focus is now on ensuring the language is both expressive and reasonably easy to parse.


**Finalizing the Structure**

Now, I've outlined the core parts of the Bison file. I'm focusing on defining the grammar rules and associating actions with them. I'm writing the necessary C code in the `%` section to handle the server configurations, including the parsing of cost, tags, and other properties, like memory. The parsing logic will be built to handle all the properties. The error handling mechanism will also be developed. The ultimate goal is a file ready for server configuration.


**Constructing the Parser**

Now, I'm delving into the heart of the Bison file. I'm focusing on crafting grammar rules to accurately mirror the structure of my server configuration language, considering the nuances of the cost format like "$120.50 / month". I am actively implementing the C code within actions to interpret the parsed configuration. Error handling is also a focus as I build the structure.


**Parsing Server Configurations**

I'm now focusing on refining the parser rules and actions within the Bison file. The structure is mostly in place, but I'm fine-tuning how to manage memory allocation and deallocation for the strings. I'm also addressing the parsing of the server cost, which requires the separation of numbers and month specification. Furthermore, I'll be adding the error handling procedures. The goal is now to solidify the parsing logic.


**Building the Lexer**

Now, I'm working on the lexer (`.l` file). I'm translating my grammar rules into regular expressions and generating the tokens required by the parser. This involves careful design for recognizing strings, numbers (integers and floats), keywords, and the more complex cost format ($X.YY / month) to prepare the input for the parsing stage.


**Structuring the Grammar**

I'm now focusing on refining the grammar rules. I've designed the top-level structure, including server definitions and properties. The critical area is the "COST" property with its '$' and the " / month" requirement, which adds complexity to the lexer and parser. I'm building actions to print the parsed server configurations.


**Parsing Server Configurations**

I've been occupied by the grammar rules, which are the cornerstone of the parsing process. I'm focusing on parsing the server cost with the format "$120.50 / month" and how to handle server configurations, including memory allocations and deallocations. Error handling is also a focus as I refine the parsing logic.

### Overview

The Wrotvax4 project aims to redefine developer interaction with their tools. Traditional IDEs rely solely on keyboard and mouse input. Wrotvax4 introduces a powerful voice and audio layer, allowing developers to perform actions, navigate codebases, and review scripts by speaking.

This repository contains all the necessary components:
*   **Desktop App:** The core Electron/Tauri-based desktop client for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Web Client:** A web-based portal for managing projects, accounts, and server settings.
*   **Servers:** The backend services that handle voice processing, user authentication, and collaborative features.

### Key Features

*   **Voice-Activated Commands:** Control your entire workflow with your voice. "Cow, run tests." "Cow, find all references to this function."
*   **Talking Script Files:** Select a block of code, a function, or an entire file and have IDECow read it back to you with proper intonation for syntax. Perfect for accessibility and code reviews.
*   **Client-Server Architecture:** Your desktop app is a powerful client that syncs with backend servers for heavy-lifting tasks like remote builds or AI-powered code analysis.
*   **Multi-Platform Desktop Program:** A native-feeling experience on your OS of choice.
*   **Integrated Web Dashboard:** Manage your projects, collaborators, and billing from any browser.
*   **Rich Image & Asset Handling:** Preview and manage project images and assets directly within the IDE.

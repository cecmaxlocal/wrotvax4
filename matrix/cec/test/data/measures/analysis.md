**Analyzing the "Web"**

I'm now focusing on the meaning of "web" in the context of a `web.yacc` file. I've considered that the term is very broad. I need to determine what aspects of a web context are important to model with a grammar file, such as HTML parsing, URL routing, or something else entirely. I'm exploring a few common web-related use cases to narrow this down further.


**Refining SWT Features**

I'm now zeroing in on the features for the Simple Web Template (SWT). I'm thinking of incorporating simple variable substitution using double curly braces, like `{{variable}}`, and basic conditional statements to provide some dynamism. I want to keep it focused on the essentials of a templating engine while showing the power of Yacc. I'm also considering how to handle comments and whitespace effectively in the parser to ensure clean output.


**Expanding SWT Capabilities**

I'm now expanding the SWT capabilities. I've decided to add support for simple arithmetic operations within variable expressions (e.g., `{{ user.age + 5 }}`). This adds a layer of complexity to the parser, but it provides a more robust and useful templating language. I also considered adding string concatenation, but that can come later. Additionally, I'm thinking about including some simple built-in functions, like a date formatting function.


**Expanding SWT Features Further**

I'm now expanding SWT. I've been working on integrating simple control flow with `if` and `for` blocks. I'm focusing on parsing the blocks correctly, managing nested structures, and generating the corresponding output. I also have to handle the keywords like `if`, `endif`, `for`, and `endfor` to make them properly interpreted as non-terminals. I also started thinking about error handling to pinpoint problematic areas in the template with more informative messages.


**Expanding Error Handling**

I'm now focusing on improving error handling in the SWT parser. I want to provide more specific error messages to the user. I'll need to track the current line number and column position. I plan to use the `yyerror` function to output more descriptive error messages, pinpointing the exact location of the error and the expected syntax. I'll also add a mechanism to recover from errors, skipping problematic tokens and attempting to continue parsing to catch more issues.


**Expanding Core Functionality**

I'm now integrating core functionality. I've designed and written the `web.yacc` file to create a Simple Web Template (SWT) system. I've also integrated double curly braces for variable substitution and basic `if` statements. I've successfully parsed text, variables, and comments, demonstrating the foundation of my template system. My next focus will be loops and error handling.


**Implementing Conditional Logic**

I'm now implementing the `if` and `else` constructs. I've successfully incorporated `if` statements into the parser, allowing for basic conditional logic within the templates. I'm focusing on ensuring correct parsing of nested `if` statements and evaluating conditions based on variables. I also started working on `else` statements.


**Integrating 'for' Loops**

I'm now integrating `for` loops into the SWT parser. I've successfully implemented the `for` and `endfor` blocks, ensuring proper parsing of the loop constructs. The parser can now handle nested loops and properly extract the loop variable and collection information. I'm focusing on the generation of the corresponding output, considering how to handle loop iterations within the template context.


**Implementing the Parser's Foundation**

I'm now focusing on creating the core of the parser. I've successfully defined the grammar rules for the Simple Web Template system, covering text nodes, variable substitution, and comments. I've also implemented the basic structure for if and for statements. The next step will be writing the lexer to handle the tokens defined in the grammar.


**Developing Lexer Rules**

I'm now focusing on writing the lexer rules for the `web.yacc` file. I'm prioritizing accurate tokenization of the SWT syntax, ensuring proper handling of whitespace and comments. I've designed rules for each token type to ensure correct identification and extraction of meaningful components from the input template text. I'm also considering how to properly manage the allocation and deallocation of string values returned by the lexer.


**Parsing SWT Syntax**

I've successfully created the basic SWT grammar. I've now defined rules for `if` statements and `for` loops, including their opening and closing tags. I'm focusing on the lexer to handle comments and text efficiently, ensuring correct tokenization. My next step is implementing the lexer rules.


**Implementing the Lexer**

Now, I'm working on the lexer (`web.l`) to complement the grammar. I'm focusing on crafting rules for tokenization, ensuring accurate identification of keywords, operators, and variable structures. I'm also considering how the lexer will handle errors and manage memory efficiently when returning token values to the parser.

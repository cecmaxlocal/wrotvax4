**Examining Documentation Requirements**

I'm currently focused on deconstructing the user's request. It's clear that the central task is to craft COW documentation for `main.yacc`. I need to ensure I understand what "COW" format entails, which seems to be the main format requirement for this documentation, and I'm figuring out how to achieve this. The specifics of `main.yacc` and how the documentation will represent it, are secondary considerations.


**Defining COW Structure**

I've clarified the 'COW' documentation structure. Focusing on the `main.yacc` parser, I'm defining its component as the central focus. I'm actively considering its objective within a hypothetical calculator context and now starting to articulate the internal workings. This involves breaking down the parsing rules and dependencies for clarity.


**Refining Parser Objectives**

I'm now refining the parser's objectives within the COW structure. Expanding the features, I'm incorporating basic arithmetic operations, parentheses for grouping, unary minus, variable assignments, and usage. The objective is to make it reasonably capable as a simple calculator.


**Detailing Grammar Rules**

I'm deep into the grammar structure of the `main.yacc` parser, focusing on "Workings". Specifically, I've broken the parser into the key elements of a hypothetical calculator: the start symbol, line structure, assignment definition, and how the expressions themselves are structured. I'm focusing on the operator precedence and associativity to ensure clarity for the user.


**Structuring the Parser's Details**

I'm now detailing the 'Workings' section. I've focused on the necessary components, clarifying dependency on the lexical analyzer and compiler, and on error-handling functionality. I'm structuring a description of the grammar rules. I'm elaborating on the Actions (C code within the Yacc rules), and also on the conceptualized symbol table and error handling to provide completeness.


**Expanding Variable Handling**

I'm now expanding the variable handling section. I'm focusing on defining how variables are declared and used. I'm carefully describing the structure and interaction of the symbol table, highlighting how the parser manages variable assignments and retrievals. This includes how the lexical analyzer provides tokens to the parser and is a critical addition.


**Outlining Documentation Structure**

Now, I've outlined the entire documentation. I'll describe a hypothetical calculator parser built for this purpose using 'COW'. I'm focusing on its essential aspects: component, objectives, and workings. Next, I'll detail the component's functionality with clear language.


**Developing the Calculator Example**

I'm now fully immersed in developing the documentation content. I've sketched the key aspects of a hypothetical calculator parser that will serve as the example for the documentation, focusing on its essential features and internal functioning. I'm focusing on the clarity of the documentation as a whole, specifically detailing each function.


**Finalizing Documentation Structure**

Now I'm finalizing the structure of the documentation. I've focused on the practical aspects. I'll include an "Example Usage & Flow" section to trace a calculator input and explain the parsing steps. I'm also ensuring the documentation reflects the COW structure, and includes key functions.

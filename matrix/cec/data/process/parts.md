**Formulating the Check File**

I'm now focusing on what a useful Yacc file called `check.yacc` might contain. The 'check' name is vague, so I'm aiming for something representative and practical. I'm exploring various possibilities to make the file valuable.


**Refining the Structure**

My current focus is on the `check.yacc` file's internal structure. I'm building on the standard Yacc structure by expanding the declarations, rules, and C code sections, as outlined. I'm examining how each section can become useful and representative, particularly how a simple calculator demonstrates all key components. I am looking for a more representative design beyond the simple calculator approach.


**Constructing the Parser**

I'm now integrating the declaration section with tokens and the union structure. This part is proving interesting! I'm adding standard includes for print and exit, as well as a preliminary union definition. Tokens like `NUMBER` and operators will be defined to connect with the parser's logic.


**Connecting the Components**

I've just connected the declaration section with tokens and the union structure. Now I'm carefully adding includes and a preliminary union definition. Tokens for numbers, operators, and end-of-line signals are being defined, connecting the parser's logic to the lexer. This phase is particularly intriguing, solidifying how the individual components will interact within the final `check.yacc` file.


**Building the Grammar**

Now, I'm working through the grammar rules in the Yacc file. I am writing rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and also for parentheses and end-of-line signals. It is taking some time to get the grammar working correctly with the expected order of operations. The line rule is now being constructed, so the program can handle multiple calculations. I am considering a `factor` and `term`, like normal, to ensure the right order.


**Constructing the Core Rules**

I am now focusing on the key rules and structure of the calculator in the `check.yacc` file. I'm building grammar for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as parentheses and end-of-line signals. It has taken time to get the grammar working correctly. The `program` and `line` rules are nearly complete to handle multiple calculations. I am using `factor` and `term`, which is standard to ensure the right order.

I've integrated the declaration section with tokens and the union structure. I'm adding standard includes for print and exit, as well as a preliminary union definition. Tokens like `NUMBER` and operators will be defined to connect with the parser's logic.


**Designing the Core Calculator**

I'm solidifying the calculator's structure, drawing from standard Yacc/Bison design principles. The `check.yacc` file will be a self-contained example, demonstrating all Yacc components. I'm focusing on defining the declaration section, including includes and the union, along with standard tokens for a simple calculator.

**Crafting a Self-Contained Example**

I'm now focusing on packaging this up as a self-contained, instructive example. The `check.yacc` file will be a simple yet complete calculator, embodying core Yacc principles. I'm building a simple calculator, as it demonstrates all necessary components in Yacc.


**Constructing a Comprehensive Example**

I've just finalized the thought process around constructing a practical `check.yacc` file. This now includes token and precedence definitions, a comprehensive grammar for a calculator with operator precedence, unary minus, and a line-based input format. The lexer and main function are incorporated, resulting in a complete and self-contained Yacc/Bison example.
